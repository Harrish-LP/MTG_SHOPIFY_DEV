However, it's crucial for mothers of children with special needs to remember that self-care is not a luxury but a necessity. Taking time for ourselves allows us to recharge, rediscover our own identities, and ultimately become better caregivers for our children.<br><br>I hope sharing <a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/pages/rose-mabizas-blog" target="_blank"><i><span style="color: rgb(74, 144, 226);">my story</span></i></a> has inspired and encouraged other women to prioritise self-care, embrace independence, and build a supportive community. Let's unite as mothers, women, and advocates for children with special needs. Together, we can break free from guilt, support each other, and celebrate the journey of motherhood while nurturing our well-being.</h3><div data-pf-type="Divider2" class="sc-fmzxHC flPvzM pf-100_"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-f6fa" data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-epRwmx cpmRjY pf-104_"><div style="--cw:1000px" class="sc-djVWQC dKziBg"><div class="sc-hzhKNl fltMam pf-105_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px;position:relative" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-pKreJ bIaXH pf-106_">
