<button class="accordion">What is death?

<p>Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living, physical organism. Death may refer to the end of life as either an event or condition. 
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Who can confirm death in the UK?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A doctor, nurse or other trained healthcare professional can verify the death. They do this by making certain checks to be sure that the person has died. It’s best not to move the body from the home before this has taken place. 
If a healthcare professional is already with you, they may be able to verify the death. If not, you will need to call the GP practice. They will make arrangements for someone to visit.
If the person dies in the evening, at night, at the weekend or on a bank holiday, call the GP, and you’ll be given a number to phone for a doctor.  <a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/products/verification-of-death-by-nurses-e-learning-course-cpd-certified?variant=20827431493"_blank""><font color="green"><u>Click here for Online Verification of Death Courses and Training.</u></font></a></p>

<button class="accordion">How do you confirm the death of a patient?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It is vital when certifying death to ensure that death has indeed occurred. In the UK at present, there is no legal definition of death, and there is no international consensus, although it is taken generally to mean the irreversible loss of capacity for consciousness combined with the irreversible loss of capacity to breathe. Guidance on the diagnosis and confirmation of death was issued in 2008 from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.

<button class="accordion">Can paramedics pronounce death in the UK?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In the UK, a nurse or paramedic can pronounce or verify death legally. You do not need a doctor to announce that someone has died. However "certifying" death is a different issue entirely.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do doctors confirm death?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Diagnosis of death has three parts: ask 'Why have they died', then diagnose death, and then wait for five minutes before confirming the death. The checklist for diagnosing death includes checking for a heartbeat and breathing and examining the eyes to check if the pupils are large and unreactive.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How many days are allowed before they must register the death?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A death should be registered within five days. Still, registration can be delayed for another nine days if the registrar is told that a medical certificate has been issued.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can a nurse verify death?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A registered nurse may perform confirmation or verification of death. However, you must check your employer's policies to determine the circumstances under which local agreements can be made.

<button class="accordion">What is the purpose of verification of death?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The purpose of the verification of death is to establish whether a patient is deceased. There is no formal legal terminology that defines 'verification of death'. All deaths should be subject to professional verification that life has ended by a suitably qualified practitioner who has completed specific training for confirmation of death. The RCN provides guidance on confirmation of death for registered and appropriately trained nurses, guided by local policy and protocol. <a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/products/verification-of-death-by-nurses-e-learning-course-cpd-certified?variant=20827431493"_blank""><font color="green"><u>Click here for Online Verification of Death Courses and Training.</u></font></a></p>
