Both types of training help reduce organisational risks and ensure compliance with policies, guidelines, and legal frameworks.
<br><br>The subjects covered in mandatory training vary depending on the workforce's needs, the organisation's type of service, and the risks encountered in the workplace. Examples of mandatory and statutory training include fire safety, data protection, child safeguarding, and basic life support. Employers can set their protocols and policies on statutory and mandatory training, with staff contractually obliged to follow.
<br><br>Statutory training comes from crucial legislation, such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Data Protection Act 1998. Common terms in compliance training include ‘mandatory’, ‘statutory’, ‘essential’, and ‘compulsory’ training. Training and compliance departments must agree on common terminologies to ensure all training delivered meets local and national requirements. Effective training planning and implementation involves gathering the necessary information on the courses covered under statutory and mandatory training and logging and evaluating all training delivered within the organisation.<br></span></p><p class="sc-bhqpXc fHzOVK pf-71_" data-pf-type="Paragraph4"><input type="checkbox" id="compact-e3f63398-9e67-462f-98ef-fe753f059d90"/><span class="pf-paragraph-content "><em><span style="color: rgb(74, 144, 226);"><a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/blogs/dr-richard-dune/what-is-the-difference-between-statutory-and-mandatory-training" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(74, 144, 226);">Click here to read about the differences between mandatory and statutory training.</span></a></span></em>

Failure to provide proper training can lead to various negative consequences, including an unsafe working environment, increased likelihood of incidents and accidents, failure to deliver high-quality care, poor staff engagement, increased dissatisfaction with work, and increased incidence of mental health problems. These consequences can also result in severe implications for service users, staff members, managers, and the organisation as a whole.<br><br>Suppose staff members fail to complete the required statutory and mandatory training. In that case, they may face an impact on their pay, progression, and development, loss of professional registration and indemnity, and claims relating to work-related injuries or ill health. Health and social care managers are also expected to provide time, opportunities, and access to mandatory training for all staff. They may face consequences like halting their progression or not receiving their pay increment if their teams need to meet their training targets.<br><br>Regulatory and legislative implications exist for organisations that fail to provide their staff with statutory and mandatory training. The Health and Safety Act 1974 requires employers to protect their employees' health, safety, and welfare, and they must instruct and train employees to deal with the risks. The UK’s health and social care regulators monitor and regulate compliance, i.e., the CQC, Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA), Health Improvement Scotland, and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales.<br><br>They may issue an improvement notice, prosecute or fine an organisation for not meeting the standards. Therefore, it is crucial to provide adequate training to employees.

These workers typically receive mandatory training from their employing agency, and it is the responsibility of each locum agency to outline their staff's access to this training. However, while these workers should not have to fund the training themselves, they do not have a statutory right to request paid time off to complete it.
<br><br>Agency staff must keep up-to-date with mandatory training to maintain their professional qualifications and increase their chances of securing work placements. Organisations that use agency staff must ensure that these individuals have undergone training on delivering safe care and maintaining a safe working environment. This may be a contractual obligation in the agency contract or a shared arrangement between the agency and the organisation. Even if an agency worker only works one shift, they pose significant risks if they have not been adequately trained or inducted into the organisation.
<br><br>Recruitment agencies in the health and social care sector must adopt healthy workplace initiatives similar to those in NHS and private sector organisations. They should address the issues raised by their workforce, including ensuring a healthy and safe working environment for staff and patients.

Despite the importance of compliance training, many organisations fail to meet their targets due to time and cost constraints, quality and relevance issues, access and inclusion challenges, and hostile culture.
<br><br>Many health and social care organisations lack the resources to release staff for training. Often, staff may feel obligated to prioritise their duties over training. The number of mandatory and statutory training courses can also become overwhelming, leading to an increased emphasis on online learning for almost all subjects. Additionally, access and inclusion to training can be problematic for staff with different working hours or accessibility needs, and a lack of IT equipment and support can hinder e-learning.
<br><br>Lastly, a negative culture surrounding mandatory and statutory training can create a poor perception and reluctance to engage in training. Improving training quality, relevance, access, and inclusion can address these barriers and improve uptake. Training and compliance managers should invest in understanding the culture around mandatory training in their organisations to identify and address these challenges.

These include time and cost, quality and relevance, assessment and inclusion, and culture.
<br><br>Statutory and mandatory training should be completed during work time or with time off in lieu. Cost efficiency should not be the primary driver. All statutory and mandatory training courses should have defined objectives and outcomes. They should also be delivered appropriately and include various activities to suit different learning styles. Assessment should demonstrate understanding and application to practice, and feedback should be used to enhance provision. Mandatory and statutory training should be based on individual knowledge and experience, and recent training at a previous employer should be transferable.
<br><br>Statutory and mandatory training should be relevant to support the individual's role, and organisations should map training to relevant workplace themes. Training should be accessible to all staff members' work patterns and locations, and staff should be offered support to improve their IT skills. Staff should understand the importance of statutory and mandatory training and value the organisation's learning provision.

<br><br>Key questions that can facilitate action and change of culture include those related to time and cost, quality and relevance, access and inclusion, and culture. These questions help to evaluate current provisions, compliance, and culture around mandatory training. They can also help identify areas for improvement and develop an action plan for the partnership. Compliance and training professionals can also engage with key influencers, such as the chair and secretary of partnership forums, to discuss partnership working and assess the quality of training provided by external providers.

They are significant in delivering workforce development programs, ensuring compliance with statutory and mandatory training, and advocating for staff needs. Employers should provide the necessary support and resources to ensure all staff members, regardless of their employment status, are capable of delivering safe care.
<br><br>Compliance and training professionals must stay updated on the latest developments, regulations, and best practices in the industry. By doing so, they can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of health and social care workplaces, making them safer, more efficient, and ultimately better places for staff and service users.
<br><br>Statutory and mandatory training frameworks provide essential guidelines for compliance and training professionals. By adhering to these frameworks and continually improving training provisions, organisations can ensure a positive workplace culture, improve staff well-being, and provide better care and services to their clients.
